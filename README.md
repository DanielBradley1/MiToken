# MiToken ![img](https://ourcloudnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GraphLogo45.png)

MiToken is a PowerShell module designed to be used with PowerShell Azure Automation runbooks. It will obtain an access token from the managed identity endpoint from within your runbook, then exchange it for a multi-tenant app access token, using the managed identity token as an assertion. 

This will allow you to connect to external tenants that have provided consent to your multi-tenant application via Microsoft Graph PowerShell in a managed identity scenario.
